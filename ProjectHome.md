<h1>WARNING: This project has been superseeded by <a href='http://code.google.com/p/bennugd-monolithic/'>bennugd-monolithic</a>, and its code and binaries should not be used anymore.</h1>

Because of the lack of [dlopen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_loading) or similar functionality for Wii homebrew development, a direct recompile of [BennuGD](http://www.bennugd.org) for the Wii is not possible.

This project aims to create a version of BennuGD (and the required Wii dependencies) that integrates all the functionality offered by the official modules of BennuGD in one single binary but keeping the number of required source code changes to the BennuGD base as low as possible. It could also serve as a basis for ports to other platforms that require static linking.

Please note that this project is still alpha quality code and there are some things that aren't working yet as expected. It is, however, already usable. You can get a quick intro on how to get it up and running at the [Getting Started](http://code.google.com/p/bennugd-wii/wiki/GettingStarted) wiki page.

For a list of working modules, please see the related [wiki page](http://code.google.com/p/bennugd-wii/wiki/Status).
