README for bennugd-wii version "Comes with music"
=================================================

by Joseba Garc√≠a Etxebarria (josebita)

This package includes a binary version of the current snapshot of the
bennugd-wii interpreter source code that can be fetched from:
http://code.google.com/p/bennugd-wii/

It includes all the functionality found in the following Bennu modules:
mod_say
mod_string
mod_math
mod_time
mod_file
mod_sound
mod_joy

To run the example code, copy the folder named "bgd-wii-cwm" to the APPS
folder in the root of your SD card, insert it into your WII and load
the Homebrew Channel, then click on the entry with the Bennu logo on it.

Have fun!
