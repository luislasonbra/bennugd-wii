If you wish to load all the examples onto the WII, do the following:

Copy bgdc.elf (or any valid WII application, for the matter) into this
folder and rename it into boot.elf.

Now, compress this folder and send it to your wii (have HBC open there)
with wiiload, say:
wiiload example.zip

HBC will ask you if you want to unzip the files there. Say yes.
A new (unfunctional) entry will have been created in your HBC, just ignore
it. Your examples will be there.
